# About me ðŸ‘‹


**RebekkaLea/RebekkaLea** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

## Some Tidbits
- I'm just getting started learning about GitHub and am looking forward to hosting and collaborating on some projects here. 
- Teaching, advising students, coordinating programs, and conducting research is my game. 
- Fun fact: I am a classically trained pianist and love playing the piano when I can. 

## Practicing Markdown
- If I write this non-sentence and use **bold** and *italics* to highlight...
- And if I put a link to my [UC Davis profile](https://writing.ucdavis.edu/people/rebekka-andersen)  

What does this look like? How about a horizontal rule next?
