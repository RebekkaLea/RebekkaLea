# About me ðŸ‘‹


**RebekkaLea/RebekkaLea** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- I'm just getting started learning about GitHub and am looking forward to hosting and collaborating on some projects here. 
- Teaching, advising students, coordinating programs, and conducting research is my game. 
- Fun fact: I am a classically trained pianist and love playing the piano when I can.
